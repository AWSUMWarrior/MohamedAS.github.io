Hi! Iâ€™m a BS Biology grad with a CS minor, and this blog is essentially my cybersecurity lab notebook. I am actively learning current and new skills related to the field such as: **Python, Linux, SQL, Wireshark**, and many more to come. 

My long-term end goal is to become a **Red Team Penetration Tester**, so I will be documenting all my projects, learning experiences, and tools along the way!
